<h4>Hi my name is Vil ðŸ‘‹ and I'm into Machine Learning ðŸ¤–</h4>

I have recently completed my <strong>BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence</strong> at the university of Kent..

If you're interested, I have a blog where I write about stuff that I'm working on or learning. You can find that by visiting <a href="https://digitalredneck.co.uk" target="_blank">Digital Redneck</a>.

Alternatively you can have a little look at some of the projects that I have worked on (not all of them are there yet).
